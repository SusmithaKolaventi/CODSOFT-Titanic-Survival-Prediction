**Overview:**
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques.
The dataset is sourced from the famous Kaggle Titanic competition. 
The primary objective is to build a predictive model based on passenger attributes like age, gender, class, etc.
Project Description:
The Titanic Survival Prediction Project is designed to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 
We explore various features of the passengers and employ multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the likelihood of survival. 
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation processes.
**Data Description**
The dataset used in this project consists of two files:
train.csv: 
The training dataset including the features and the target variable (Survived).
test.csv:
The test dataset without the target variable.
**Usage:**
Ensure you have the dataset file Titanic-Dataset.csv in the project directory. 
Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
**Project Structure:**

**Results:** 
The Random Forest Classifier model is trained and evaluated on the Titanic dataset.
The performance metrics include accuracy and classification report.
